# MachineLearningAPI
This repo will store all project data/tutorials/notebooks for my ML API project where I'll be leading Codeology club members in building their own ML APIs.

## 101 Documents
* [Interview Matching System](doc/Setup 101.md)

The rough schedule for the 8 week project is as follows: 
1. Setup paperspace + 101
2. CNNs + data augmentation
3. Embeddings + structured Neural Nets
4. Collab. filtering + RNNs
5. GANs
6. Data set + training
7. Building API + hosting model
8. Extras/misc.
